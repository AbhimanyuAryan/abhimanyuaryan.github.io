For instance, Google DeepMind's AlphaGo benefits from a well-defined reward function that guides its learning process, optimizing strategies for winning Go games through reinforcement learning. This reward function serves as a clear measure of performance, facilitating targeted improvements. However, for LLMs, defining a comparable reward function is complex due to the vast array of tasks they are designed to handle, ranging from text generation to question answering and beyond. The absence of a singular, quantifiable goal makes it difficult to optimize LLMs in the same way.
